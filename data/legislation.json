agreement whereby the debtor is enabled to receive from time to time (whether in his own person, or by another person) from the creditor or a third party cash, goods and services (or any of them) to an amount or value such that, taking into account payments made by or to the credit of the debtor, the credit limit (if any) is not at any time exceeded; and\r(b)fixed-sum credit is any other facility under a [F1consumer] credit agreement whereby the debtor is enabled to receive credit (whether in one amount or by instalments).\r(2)In relation to running-account credit, “credit limit ” means, as respects any period, the maximum debit balance which, under the credit agreement, is allowed to stand on the account during that period, disregarding any term of the agreement allowing that maximum to be exceeded merely temporarily.\r(3)For the purposes of [F2any provision of this Act that specifies an amount of credit (except section 17(1)(a))] , running-account credit shall be taken not to exceed the amount specified in [F3that provision]( “the specified amount ”) if—\r(a)the credit limit does not exceed the specified amount; or\r(b)whether or not there is a credit limit, and if there is, notwithstanding that it exceeds the specified amount,—\r(i)the debtor is not enabled to draw at any one time an amount which, so far as (having regard to section 9(4)) it represents credit, exceeds
