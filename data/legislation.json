agreement whereby the debtor is enabled to receive from time to time (whether in his own person, or by another person) from the creditor or a third party cash, goods and services (or any of them) to an amount or value such that, taking into account payments made by or to the credit of the debtor, the credit limit (if any) is not at any time exceeded; and\r(b)fixed-sum credit is any other facility under a [F1consumer] credit agreement whereby the debtor is enabled to receive credit (whether in one amount or by instalments).\r(2)In relation to running-account credit, “credit limit ” means, as respects any period, the maximum debit balance which, under the credit agreement, is allowed to stand on the account during that period, disregarding any term of the agreement allowing that maximum to be exceeded merely temporarily.\r(3)For the purposes of [F2any provision of this Act that specifies an amount of credit (except section 17(1)(a))] , running-account credit shall be taken not to exceed the amount specified in [F3that provision]( “the specified amount ”) if—\r(a)the credit limit does not exceed the specified amount; or\r(b)whether or not there is a credit limit, and if there is, notwithstanding that it exceeds the specified amount,—\r(i)the debtor is not enabled to draw at any one time an amount which, so far as (having regard to section 9(4)) it represents credit, exceeds

under a regulated consumer credit agreement, other than an excluded agreement, may withdraw from the agreement, without giving any reason, in accordance with this section.\r(2)To withdraw from an agreement under this section the debtor must give oral or written notice of the withdrawal to the creditor before the end of the period of 14 days beginning with the day after the relevant day.\r(3)For the purposes of subsection (2) the relevant day is whichever is the latest of the following—\r(a)the day on which the agreement is made;\r(b)where the creditor is required to inform the debtor of the credit limit under the agreement, the day on which the creditor first does so;\r(c)in the case of an agreement to which section 61A (duty to supply copy of executed consumer credit agreement) applies, the day on which the debtor receives a copy of the agreement under that section or on which the debtor is informed as specified in subsection (3) of that section;\r(d)in the case of an agreement to which section 63 (duty to supply copy of executed agreement: excluded agreements) applies, the day on which the debtor receives a copy of the agreement under that section.\r(4)Where oral notice under this section is given to the creditor it must be given in a manner specified in the agreement.\r(5)Where written notice under this section is given by facsimile transmission or electronically—\r(a)it must be sent to the number or electronic address specified for the purpose in the agreement, and\r(b)where it is so sent, it is to be regarded as having been received by the creditor at the time it is sent (and section 176A does not apply).\r(6)Where written notice under this section is given in any other form—\r(a)it must be sent by post to, or left at, the postal address specified for the purpose in the agreement, and\r(b)where it is sent by post to that address, it is to be regarded as having been received by the creditor at the time of posting (and section 176 does not apply).\r(7)Subject as follows, where the debtor withdraws from a regulated consumer credit agreement under this section—\r(a)the agreement shall be treated as if it had never been entered into, and\r(b)where an ancillary service relating to the agreement is or is to be provided by the creditor, or by a third party on the basis of an agreement between the third party and the creditor, the ancillary service contract shall be treated as if it had never been entered into.\r(8)In the case referred to in subsection (7)(b) the creditor must without delay notify any third party of the fact that the debtor has withdrawn from the agreement.\r(9)Where the debtor withdraws from an agreement under this section—\r(a)the debtor must repay to the creditor any credit provided and the interest accrued on it (at the rate provided for under the agreement), but\r(b)the debtor is not liable to pay to the creditor any compensation, fees or charges except any non-returnable charges paid by the creditor to a public administrative body.\r(10)An amount payable under subsection (9) must be paid without undue delay and no later than the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day after the day on which the notice of withdrawal was given (and if not paid by the end of that period may be recovered by the creditor as a debt).\r(11)Where a regulated consumer credit agreement is a

agreement, may by notice terminate the agreement, free of charge, at any time, subject to any period of notice not exceeding one month provided for by the agreement.\r(2)Notice under subsection (1) need not be in writing unless the creditor so requires.\r(3)Where a regulated open-end consumer credit agreement, other than an excluded agreement, provides for termination of the agreement by the creditor—\r(a)the termination must be by notice served on the debtor, and\r(b)the termination may not take effect until after the end of the period of two months, or such longer period as the agreement may provide, beginning with the day after the day on which notice is served.\r(4)Where a regulated open-end consumer credit agreement, other than an excluded agreement, provides for termination or suspension by the creditor of the debtor's right to draw on credit—\r(a)to terminate or suspend the right to draw on credit the creditor must serve a notice on the debtor before the termination or suspension or, if that is not practicable, immediately afterwards,\r(b)the notice must give reasons for the termination or suspension, and\r(c)the reasons must be objectively justified.\r(5)Subsection (4)(a) and (b) does not apply where giving the notice—\r(a)is prohibited by an EU obligation, or\r(b)would, or would be likely to, prejudice—\r(i)the prevention or detection of crime,\r(ii)the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or\r(iii)the administration of justice.\r(6)An objectively justified reason under subsection (4)(c) may, for example, relate to—\r(a)the unauthorised or fraudulent use of credit, or\r(b)a significantly increased risk of the debtor being unable to fulfil his obligation to repay the credit.\r(7)Subsections (1) and (3) do not affect any right to terminate an agreement for breach of contract.\r(8)For the purposes of this section an agreement is an excluded agreement if it is—\r(a)an authorised non-business overdraft agreement,\r(b)an authorised business overdraft agreement,\r(c)a debtor-creditor agreement arising where the holder of a current account overdraws on the account without a pre-arranged overdraft or exceeds a pre-arranged overdraft limit, or\r(d)an agreement secured on land.]\rTextual AmendmentsF1S. 98A inserted (1.2.2011) by The Consumer Credit (EU Directive) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1010), regs. 38,

terminate hire agreement.U.K.(1)The hirer under a regulated consumer hire agreement is entitled to terminate the agreement by giving notice to any person entitled or authorised to receive the sums payable under the agreement.\r(2)Termination of an agreement under subsection (1) does not affect any liability under the agreement which has accrued before the termination.\r(3)A notice under subsection (1) shall not expire earlier than eighteen months after the making of the agreement, but apart from that the minimum period of notice to be given under subsection (1), unless the agreement provides for a shorter period, is as follows.\r(4)If the agreement provides for the making of payments by the hirer to the owner at equal intervals, the minimum period of notice is the length of one interval or three months, whichever is less.\r(5)If the agreement provides for the making of such payments at differing intervals, the minimum period of notice is the length of the shortest interval or three months, whichever is less.\r(6)In any other case, the minimum period of notice is three months.\r(7)This section does not apply to—\r(a)any agreement which provides for the making by the hirer of payments which in total (and without breach of the agreement) exceed [F1£1,500] in any year, or\r(b)any agreement where—\r(i)goods are bailed or (in Scotland) hired to the hirer for the purposes of a business carried on by him, or the hirer holds himself out as requiring the goods for those purposes, and\r(ii)the goods are selected by the hirer, and acquired by the owner for the purposes of the agreement at the request of the hirer from any person other than the owner’s associate, or\r(c)any agreement where the hirer requires, or holds himself out as requiring, the goods for the purpose of bailing or hiring them to other persons in the course of a business carried on by him.\r(8)If, on an application made to the [F2FCA] by a person carrying on a consumer hire business, it appears to the [F2FCA] that it would be in the interest of hirers to do so, [F3it] may F4... direct that [F5, subject to such conditions (if any) as it may specify, this section shall not apply to

(1), where a regulated agreement is enforceable on an order of the court or the [F1FCA] only, any security provided in relation to the agreement is enforceable (so far as provided in relation to the

or to the debtor under a credit agreement include—\r(a)references to the person to whom his rights and duties under the agreement have passed by assignment or operation of law;\r(b)where two or more persons are the creditor or the debtor, references to any one or more of those persons.\r(3)The definition of ‘court’ in section 189(1) does not apply for the purposes of sections 140A and 140B.\r(4)References in sections 140A and 140B to an agreement related to a credit agreement (the ‘main agreement’) are references to—\r(a)a credit agreement consolidated by the main agreement;\r(b)a linked transaction in relation to the main agreement or to a credit agreement within paragraph (a);\r(c)a security provided in relation to the main agreement, to a credit agreement within paragraph (a) or to a linked transaction within paragraph (b).\r(5)In the case of a credit agreement which is not a regulated consumer credit agreement, for the purposes of subsection (4) a transaction shall be treated as being a linked transaction in relation to that agreement if it would have been such a transaction had that agreement been a regulated consumer credit agreement.\r(6)For the purposes of this section and section 140B the definitions of ‘security’ and ‘surety’ in section 189(1) apply (with any appropriate changes) in relation to—\r(a)a credit agreement which is not a consumer credit agreement as if it were a consumer credit agreement; and\r(b)a transaction which is a linked transaction by virtue of subsection (5).\r(7)For the purposes of this section a credit agreement (the ‘earlier agreement’) is consolidated by another credit agreement (the ‘later agreement’) if—\r(a)the later agreement is entered into by the debtor (in whole or in part) for purposes connected with debts owed by virtue of the earlier agreement; and\r(b)at any time prior to the later agreement being entered into the parties to the earlier agreement included—\r(i)the debtor under the later agreement; and\r(ii)the creditor under the later agreement or an associate or a former associate of his.\r(8)Further, if the later agreement is itself consolidated by another credit agreement (whether by virtue of this subsection or subsection (7)), then the earlier agreement is consolidated by that other agreement as well.]]\rTextual AmendmentsF1S. 140A and preceding cross-heading inserted
